## Research Interests
My research explores social, cognitive, and philosophical questions, with a focus on illuminating the subtle nuances in human thought, belief, and behavior. I am particularly interested in how simplified categories or dichotomies influence perception, social judgment, and decision-making, as well as how scientific questions themselves are framed and studied. I aim to advance research that reveals the subtle mechanisms underlying human behavior to inform more nuanced theory, research practices, and applications in psychology and related fields.
